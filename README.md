![build](https://github.com/eigenhombre/mkrust/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Early version of my work-in-progress Rust project generator.

Since I work in several languages, and since various project tasks such as building,
releasing, etc. are conceptually the same, I like to give `make` targets to common operations,
and this template reflects that approach.


# Building

1. Install Rust and Cargo
1. Define `RUSTPATH` in your environment to point to the directory
   where you want to create your Rust projects.
1. `cd` to that directory.
3. If you want newly-created binaries to go somewhere other than `$HOME/bin`,
   define `RUSTBIN` in your environment.
2. Clone this repo
3. `cd mkrust`
4. `make install`

# Usage

1. `mkrust <project-name>`
2. `cd $RUSTPATH/<project-name>`
3. `make`
4. Try it out with `./target/debug/<project-name>`
5. `make install` to install the binary in `$HOME/bin`.
6. After adding any unit tests, `make test` to run them.

# Docs

`make doc` will generate docs and open them in your browser.
