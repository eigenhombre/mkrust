![build](https://github.com/eigenhombre/mkrust/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Early version of my work-in-progress Rust project generator.

Probably don't use this.  I'm not very good at Rust yet.

Since I work in several languages, and since various project tasks such as building,
releasing, etc. are conceptually the same, I like to give `make` targets to common operations,
and this template reflects that approach.

# Building

1. Install Rust and Cargo
2. Clone this repo
3. `make install`

# Usage

1. Define `RUSTPATH` in your environment to point to the directory
   where you want to create your Rust projects.
2. `mkrust <project-name>`
3. `cd $RUSTPATH/<project-name>`
4. `make`
5. Try it out with `./target/debug/<project-name>`
6. `make install` to install the binary in `$HOME/bin`.
7. After adding any unit tests, `make test` to run them.

# Docs

`make doc` will generate docs and open them in your browser.
